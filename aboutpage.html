<h3><font size="5" font color="red">Overview</font></h3>
<p><font size="3" font color="black">A real-time, online checklist program, mBird has revolutionized the way that the birding community reports and accesses information about birds. Launched in 2017 by the Information Technology lab of Velammal College of Engineering and Technology. mBird provides rich data sources for basic information on bird abundance and distribution at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. mBird goal is to maximize the utility and accessibility of the vast numbers of bird observations made each year by recreational and professional bird watchers. It is amassing one of the largest and fastest growing biodiversity data resources in existence. In time these data will become the foundation for a better understanding of bird distribution across different areas.</p></font>
